    "- We will use a **tuple** for the card values because they never change, and a **list** for the deck because cards get removed.\n",
    "- The deck will contain **52 cards**, and we will shuffle it before dealing.\n",
    "- Both player and dealer start with **2 cards each**, stored in lists since hands can grow.\n",
    "- The **player turn** will use a loop to ask for “hit” or “stand,” showing the total each time.\n",
    "- A custom function will calculate totals and handle **Ace logic** (11 → 1 if needed).\n",
    "- The **dealer turn** is automatic: draw cards until reaching **17 or more**.\n",
    "- After both turns, totals are compared to determine the result (win, lose, bust, or tie).\n",
    "- We will organize everything using multiple functions: deck creation, dealing cards, calculating totals, player turn, dealer turn, showing hands, winner logic, and a main game function.\n",
